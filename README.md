## The Anonymous Search Engine

Using the Brave API for research, we combine this with the security provided by the decentralized network, specifically the Nym Technologies SA mixnet. The result? 100% anonymous and secure online consultations! ü•∑üèº

Our search tool preserves the confidentiality of metadata by ensuring that each application fetch occurs across a distributed network, further reinforcing user privacy.
